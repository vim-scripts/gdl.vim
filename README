gdl.vim is a syntax highlighting package for the graph description language GDL (fka VCG).

Whenever you open a .gdl or .vcg file, the package automatically analyzes the text and marks keywords, attribute specifications, comments, etc. using customizable colors. Whenever you start writing a new GDL document, it automatically analyzes the new text for the proper spelling/syntax, highlighting correct items.

Benefit to you: your GDL file is easier to read and you can understand GDL source code faster.

gdl.vim is intended to go beyond simple syntax and spell-checking. It should also check attribute-value pairs for type correctness. In some cases, it will even check if a specified number is within the valid range.

The package was tested under Vim 5.6/Linux, gVim 6.1/WinNT4.0, gVim 6.2/Win2000, and gVim6.3/Win2000.
